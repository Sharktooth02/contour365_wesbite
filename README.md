This website is an experiment using different concepts and ways of presenting data, text and images in an effective way to capture the audience. By using percentages and flexible values the website is responsive to all devices including mobiles, tablets and computers. What let me down was transferring my thoughts into HTML. Most of the ideas I had planned required, more knowledge and experience in HTML and CSS but also include JavaScript which I have limited experience in. After a change in plan, I limited the website to only HTML and CSS. This kept things simple without overcomplicating anything and made the website more consistent and functional.

The original sketches are hard to see but I continued using the idea of cards and the information being separated by blocks this can be seen in the "About Us" tab where all the members have their own card. The idea of having all the artwork in a floating space to click and hover for more infomation was too difficult with just using HTML and CSS, this idea required lots of JavaScript and other programs that would be too challenging. It would have been good to see what this idea would look like because I think it could be a great way to store all the images and information interactively.
